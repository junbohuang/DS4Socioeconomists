# Tutorial 8

This tutorial will cover the linear probability model (LPM) and the root mean squared error. You will learn:

-   how to run & interpret a LPM

-   the problems coming with a LPM

-   how to calculate & interpret the in-sample root mean squared error

# Exercises

Create a .qmd-file and solve the tasks there. Store it in the JupyterHub folder "Session 8".

## Linear Probability Model

Create a model explaining "high_rating" (= binary endogenous variable) and run a linear probability model.

You first have to generate the dummy variable "high_rating" which should be equal to 1 if n_review_scores_rating\>94 and 0 otherwise.

Choose the exogenous variables that you think explain "high_rating" most in your model. What can be problematic about linear probability models?

### Root mean squared error

Calculate the in-sample root mean squared error (RMSE). It measures the average difference between values predicted by a model and the observed values and provides an estimation of how well the model is able to predict the target value.
