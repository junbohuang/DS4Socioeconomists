### Overall
    1. Keep the directory clean and easy to (re-)use
    2. Remove unneeded files
    3. Centralized storage for images with more structure
    4. Use proper version control with e.g., Git. Do not do version control with suffix, e.g., exam_2.qmd, exam_3.qmd.

### Session 1: Introduction

    a. Goal: We want to ask ourselves what the motivation is for introducing pair programming? does the current content deliever our goal?
        1. I personally find it a bit too theoretical. Since it is the first class I prefer to give students a session to show them what they can expect, content-wise and tool-wise. 
        2. We can talk about AI use in this session. 
    b. Todos: 
        1. missing images
    c. Suggestions: 
        1. add content on using R (what is a "package" and how to install packages?)

    b. Todos: 
        1. missing images
    c. Suggestions: 
        1. the goal of the session is not self-explanatory in the tutorial slides. Needs a major rework. 

### Session 3 Data and Functions
    a. Goal: 
        1. Intro to loading/reading data from local/remote; 
        2. Intro to using/defining functions in R

    c. Suggestions:
        
### Session 4 Reproducible Research
    a. Goal:
        1. best practices on reproducible research 
            (1) variable naming convention
            (2) documentation ...
    b. Todos: 
        1. more structure
    c. Suggestions:
        1. why is AI mentioned here?
        
### Session 5 Visualization a.
    a. Goal:
        1. get familiar with ggplot (syntaxs, functionality, architecture behind i.e., global vs local aesthetics)
        2. intro to different types of plots with ggplot
    b. Todos:
        1. missing images
    c. Suggestions: 
        1. more structure
        
### Session 6 Visualization b.
    a. Goal:
        1. add plot label/axes/scales/legends/
    b. Todos:
    c. Suggestions:
        
### Session 7 Linear Regression a.
    a. Goal: 
        1. Running a linear regression model with R and learning to interprete the output (high-level)
    b. Todos:
        1. more structure
        2. move equation image to ./imgaes/
    c. Suggestions:
    
### Session 8 Linear Regression b.
    a. Goal: 
        1. in-depth understanding in-sample and out-of-sample fit (interpretation)
    b. Todos:  
    c. Suggestions:
        
### Session 9 LPM and Logistic Regression
    a. Goal:
        1. understand why logistic regression is classification
        2. understand why the returned coefficient is not directly interpretable (because of log-transform)
    b. Todos:
        1. missing images
    c. Suggestions:
        
### Session 10 Evaluation, cross validation

        2. relevant metrics for regression and classification
        3. cross validation
    b. Todos:
    c. Suggestions:
        
### Session 11 Dimensionality Reduction
    a. Goal:

    b. Todos:
    c. Suggestions:
        
### Session 12 Trees
    a. Goal:
        1. nonlinear algorithm
    b. Todos:
        1. move images to ./images/
    c. Suggestions:
        1. show students step by step how to construct a decision tree (it was less focus but there is an 8-point question in the exam). Students do not get this so well in the semester.
