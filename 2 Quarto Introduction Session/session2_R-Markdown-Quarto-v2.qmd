# Getting started

## Structure and Folders

::: panel-tabset
## Jupyter Hub Log In

sign in at [Jupyter Hub](https://code.min.uni-hamburg.de)

## Working together

-   singning in for a group via OpenOlat - once you've joined (e.g.) the ***group number 13*** you're in this team for all excercises

-   in these groups you will code together, help and learn from each other - and you will comment on the work of other groups

# Procedure in further exercises

-   start Zoom
-   get input and todays tasks
-   when we start the breakout sessions join the team that you've chosen before
-   now your ready to start the pair programming
-   once you're finished: store your code-snippets in a qmd (Quarto-doc) at the Jupyter Hub
-   peer review the other groups then pick up your code and comment on it

# Coding

# Commenting on code

These kind of comments are for your own documentation of the progress.

## Need help?

You can also look at the internet for help - most error messages won't be new, so someone might have written a solution for that kind of problem online

Websites like [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are really helpful

# Exercise 1

Today we want to get to know Quarto - and want to get to know you!

Create a introduction page about your team. Think about info about your...

-   age

-   favorite tv show

-   favorite color

-   city of origin

-   ...

::: panel-tabset
## new document {.smaller}

-   Create a new Quarto document and give it your groups name
-   Create a headline with the current date

## markdown basics {.smaller}

-   In your document, create headings of different levels (e.g., H1, H2).
-   Add a bullet list and a numbered list - check out the formatting options

## tables {.smaller}

-   Create a simple table with sample data in your Markdown document.
-   Use Quarto's table formatting options to style the table.

## images {.smaller}

-   Download a picture and add this image your document, now use the link to the picture to embed it.
    -   Check out the options once the picture is embedded (with the three dots in the right corner) - change size and position of the picture
    -   What are the advantages/disadvantages of using a downloaded image vs. a link?

## writing code {.smaller}

-   Insert a R code chunk into your document.
-   Insert a R code chunk that is executable in your document.
-   Write a simple R expression inside the code chunk (calculate 2 + 2) and display the result.
-   Can you spot the difference within different types of code blocks?

## YAML header {.smaller}

-   in the header: add the names of the group members as authors
-   play around with other options like title, background-color and others

## Rendering {.smaller}

-   render to html
-   check out the result

# Exercise 2

R as a calculator\
In the same Quarto-doc:

::: nonincremental
1.  What's: **12+8\*145-28+13/2**?
2.  Is the result the same as **5\*243**? - check by hand and with true/false
3.  Take the square root the first and the second calculation
4.  Round the results to whole numbers

# Outlook to next weeks exercise

-   Working with Types and Matrices

-   Writing and using functions
