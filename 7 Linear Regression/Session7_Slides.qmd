# Recap

real world: $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + u_i$

our model: $\hat{y_i} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1} x_i$

**important formulas:**

***RSS***\
$$RSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(y_i - \hat{y_i} \right)^2 =  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(y_i - \hat{\beta_0} - \hat{\beta_1} x_i \right)^2$$

RSS (residual sum of squares) should be minimized

***Covariance***

$Cov(x, y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - E(x)) (y_i - E(y)) \\= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y})$

***Calculating the coefficients***

## commands to run a linear regression:

We want to know how the cleaning fee can be explained by the number of beds (x \~ y)

```{r}
usd_cleaning_fee <- airbnbsmall$usd_cleaning_fee
n_beds <- airbnbsmall$n_beds
lm(usd_cleaning_fee ~ n_beds)
```

Interpretation: For a flat with zero beds the cleaning fee would be on average 14.43\$. By each additional bed the cleaning fee would rise up by 11.64\$

Does this sound reasonable to us? Paying more for the cleaning of the flat if it allows for more people to sleep there sounds legit.

# Exercises

Create a .qmd-file and solve the tasks there. Store it in the JupyterHub folder "Session 7".

Please use the airbnbsmall data set. Use our package "sozoekds" to load the data set. Make sure to have installed the package first.

Some of you had difficulties using this package.

This is why we have created a workaround:

Make sure, that the file called *data_sozoekds_package.RData* is copied into your working folder (click on it, then on more, then use copy-to and select your working folder)

```{r}
load("data_sozoekds_package.RData")
```

## 1) Make yourself familiar with the dataset:

1.  How many observations does it comprise?

2.  How many variables?

## 2) Linear Regression:

1.  Think about a simple linear regression model with one exogenous variable explaining "price" (= endogenous variable). Write down the equation of your model.\
    Note: Do NOT use a variable that starts with d\_ , those are dummy variables and will be handled later on

2.  Calculate the intercept and regression coefficient estimate by hand. Remember the formula from the lecture (p.11).

3.  Then, run the regression using a suitable R command. Compare your results to the ones you calculated by hand and interpret the coefficient and intercept.

## 3) Plotting

Plot the relationship of price and number of accommodates, include a trend-line. Take a closer look at the plot and draw conclusions in terms of the explanatory power of the model.

# Solutions:

First: Load data, add package to library etc.

1\)

```{r}
airbnbsmall <- airbnbsmall

# number of rows: number of observations
nrow(airbnbsmall)

# number of columns: number of different variables
ncol(airbnbsmall)
```

2\)

**my model:** $$\hat{price} = \hat{basiccosts} + \hat{cost per guest} * numberaccommodates$$

**true model**

$${price} = {basiccosts} + {cost per guest} * numberaccommodates + errorterm $$

```{r}
#calculation of b1hat
# y is price (this is supposed to be explained)
# x is n_accommodates (this is used for the explanation)
cov_xy <- cov(airbnbsmall$n_accommodates, airbnbsmall$price)
var_x <- var(airbnbsmall$n_accommodates)

b1hat <- cov_xy/var_x

mean_y <- mean(airbnbsmall$price)
mean_x <- mean(airbnbsmall$n_accommodates)

b0hat <- mean_y-b1hat*mean_x

print (paste("b1hat is", b1hat))
print (paste("b0hat (intercept) is", b0hat))
```

```{r}
#regression
lm(airbnbsmall$price ~ airbnbsmall$n_accommodates)
```

## Interpretation: 

Explaining the price of the airbnb listing by the number of accommodates leads to the following results:

-   the basic-price regardless of guests is 14.33\$. This could represent a standard fee that the host always has to pay to the platform and that is therefore always existent.

-   an increase by one of the number of accommodates increases the price by 25.83\$. This seems reasonable since more guests need more space, more beds, more dishes...

## Plot

We can see that the price varies a lot. Using only the number of accommodates as a metric to explain the price does not serve the complexity of the data.

```{r}
ggplot(data=airbnbsmall, mapping = aes(x=n_accommodates, y= price)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = "Price and number of accommodates for Airbnb listings", x = "Number of accommodates", y= "price in $")
```
