## Exam Structure and example tasks 

-   Exam will be paper & pen

-   Questions and tasks are based on the lecture and tutorials

-   There will be no coding “by hand” but you will still work with code

## Structure

-   ⅓ of points is in MC questions (examples below)

-   ⅔ of points in text tasks

    1.  Code explanation (extensive example below)

    2.  Interpretation of regression (example below)

    3.  something on trees/validation/evaluation etc.(no example since we have not had these topics yet)

## **Task 1 - MC tasks:**

can be based on lecture content and tutorial content, asking about concepts, programming-terms, statistical formulas…

1.  The challenge of the Big Data revolution can be described with several V’s. Which term is not part of the challenge?

    a.  Volume of data
    b.  Veracity of data
    c.  Visibility of data
    d.  Velocity of data

2.  What does the gg in the package ggplot2 stand for?

    a.  generation of graphics
    b.  gestalt rules of graphics
    c.  grammar of graphics
    d.  generalization of graphics

3.  Which of the following statements is/are not true?

    a.  Lists are special types of vectors which might contain elements of different classes.
    b.  Lists are special types of data frames.
    c.  Factors are used to represent categorical data and can be unordered or ordered.
    d.  Unlike matrices, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column.

## Task 2 - Code explanation

We have a code snippet working with the examscores dataset that you know from the lectures. 

1.  The code takes certain steps with the data like transformations, selection etc. Trace those steps and execute them manually to fill in the data table. You might have to delete/create columns and/or rows.

    ```{r}
    exam_score <- examscores
    exam_score$full_score <-(exam_score$ReadingScore + exam_score$WritingScore +
    exam_score$ReadingScore)/3


    exam_score$full_score <- round(exam_score$full_score, digits=0)
    exam_score$grade <- ifelse(exam_score$full_score >= 90, "A",
                    	ifelse(exam_score$full_score >= 80 &  
                             	exam_score$full_score <= 89, "B",
                     	ifelse(exam_score$full_score >= 70 &  exam_score$full_score <= 79, "C",
                            	ifelse(exam_score$full_score >= 60 &  exam_score$full_score <= 69, "D", "E"
                                  	))))
    ```

```{r}
#Sample data was generated with this code
library(sozoekds)
library(dplyr)
examscores <- examscores
set.seed(123)  #Seed for reproducability
sampled_examscores <- examscores[sample(nrow(examscores), 15), ]

sampled_examscores$EthnicGroup <- NULL
sampled_examscores$ParentEduc <- NULL
sampled_examscores$LunchType <- NULL
sampled_examscores$ParentMaritalStatus <- NULL
sampled_examscores$PracticeSport <- NULL
sampled_examscores$IsFirstChild <- NULL
sampled_examscores$NrSiblings <- NULL
sampled_examscores$TransportMeans <- NULL

rename(sampled_examscores, observation_number = X )

sampled_examscores
```

2.  Choose the right plot for code-snippet, explain plot and make assumptions about distribution, mean etc.
