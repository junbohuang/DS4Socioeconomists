# Solutions

## 1. Identify at least three issues with the provided code example in terms of documentation and variable naming.

-   Lack of comments: There are no comments explaining the purpose of the functions or the logic within them.
-   Unclear variable names: Variable names like `a`, `b`, and `df` don't provide clear indications of their purpose or content.
-   Absence of function description: There's no documentation specifying what the `analyze_data` function does or what input it expects.

## 2. Why is it important to have clear and descriptive variable names in code for reproducible research?

-   enhance code readability and understanding for both the coder and collaborators

-   descriptive variable names contribute to transparency making it easier for others to follow the logic and replicate the analysis without confusion or misinterpretation

## 3. How does adding comments to code contribute to the reproducibility of research?

-   Comments provide crucial insights into the logic, purpose, and functionality of the code
-   Comments serve as documentation, guiding others through the code base
-   Comments explain the logic behind specific steps, functions, or calculations, facilitating replication and comprehension of the research process.

## 4. How can we make the code work smoother and with less errors?

-   Add info about the needed data types of the input variables
-   Do a check within the function if the provided data fits this type

# Code

```{r}
# Function to perform data analysis
calculate_result <- function(input_data) {
  # Perform calculations: double the first element and add 10 to the second element
  # input data needs to be numbers (numeric, integers, doubles etc.), this can be assured by conversion
  input_data <- as.numeric(input_data)
  
 # Check if any elements in the input_data are non-numeric (with the ! that stands for not) or (|) NA
  if (any(is.na(input_data) | !is.numeric(input_data))) {
    print("One or more elements of the given data are not numbers or contain NA")
  } else {
    # Perform calculations only if all elements are numeric
   doubled_first_element <- input_data[1] * 2
  increased_second_element <- input_data[2] + 10
  
  # Compute the result by adding the calculated values
  final_result <- doubled_first_element + increased_second_element
  
  # Return the final result
  return(final_result)
}
}
# Example dataset
input_values <- c(7, 8)  # Replace these values with the actual dataset

# Calling the function to analyze the data and obtain the result
analysis_output <- calculate_result(input_values)

# Display the output of the analysis
print(analysis_output)
```

## **What is new?**

-   added comments

-   variable names were improved

-   info about needed variable types was given

-   a check for the correct data type was added
