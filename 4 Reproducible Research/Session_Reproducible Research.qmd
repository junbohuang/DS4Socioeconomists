# Troubleshooting

![](https://cdn.memes.com/up/23422781594433255/i/1595886688295.jpg)

-   We have created a link-list with all things helpful - this can be found under "helpful stuff" [at OpenOlat](https://www.openolat.uni-hamburg.de/auth/RepositoryEntry/340099667/CourseNode/108537309191894)

-   The code of the lecture-, exercise- and solution slides can be copied! This way you can adapt it to your needs and don't need to start from scratch.

## Usage of AI tools like UHHGPT {#sec-usage-of-ai-tools-like-uhhgpt}

::: callout-warning
Even though its tempting: Try not to simply copy-paste answers given by AI. Instead you should try to understand the code there and work with that new knowledge in your own code.
:::

***Helpful prompts:***

-   To understand code from lecture/tutorial-slides: "Please explain *this code* to me and tell me, which steps were taken."

-   To inform yourself about other solutions: "I have *this code* for *this kind of problem*. Please show me a different way of solving that problem"

-   To inform yourself about packages/functions: "I want to solve *this problem*. Is there an existing package for that purpose? Can I use an existing function? Please tell me its name and give an example for the usage."

# Guidelines to names in coding {#sec-guidelines-to-names-in-coding}

"Naming variables follow a simple idea: Create variables that describe their function and which follow a consistent theme throughout your code." (Coding best practices [by University of Colorado Boulder](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming/coding-best-practices.html))

::: nonincremental
-   Multiword expressions - choose **one** theme and stick with it!
    -   whitespace should not be used

    -   Snakecase: variable_one; variable_two (Words are delimited by an underscore)

    -   PascalCase: VariableOne; VariableTwo (Words are delimited by capital letters)

    -   camelcase: variableOne; variableTwo (Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word)

# Guidelines for using comments {#sec-guidelines-for-using-comments}

*" It is entirely possible to “over comment” code. Code should be designed in an efficient, consistent and intuitive manner such that comments enhance user understanding but are not needed to describe the entire code."* (Coding best practices [by University of Colorado Boulder](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programming/coding-best-practices.html))

```{r}
test_function <- function(birthyear) { #commenting here works fine
   age <- #commenting here creates an error 2024 - birthyear 
     age <- 2024 - birthyear
   # commenting here creates an error return (age)
   return(age) # commenting here works
}

test_function(1921)
```

# Example: Making "AI"s with [Llama 3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B) {#sec-example-making-ais-with-llama-3}

    ::: callout-important
    Please do not share the following code snippet.
    :::

-   This is for getting to know constructs in programming

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(httr)
library(glue)
library(jsonlite)

# Define the function
make_llama3_api_call <- function(model_param, x) {
  # Define the URL
  url <- "https://turbo.skynet.coypu.org/"
  
  # Create the request payload as a list
  data <- list(
    messages = list(
      list(
        role = "user",
        content = paste0(model_param, "\n", x)
      )
    ),
    temperature = 0.2,
    max_new_tokens = 10
  )
  
  # Attempt the POST request
  tryCatch({
    # Make the POST request, encoding the body as JSON
    response <- POST(url, body = data, encode = "json")
    
    # Check if the request was successful
    if (status_code(response) == 200) {
      # Parse the response content
      content_data <- content(response, as = "parsed", type = "application/json")
      
      # Extract and return the "content" field if available
      return(content_data$content)
    } else {
      # Handle the case where the request fails
      stop("Request failed with status code: ", status_code(response))
    }
  }, error = function(e) {
    # Catch and return any errors encountered
    return(e$message)
  })
}
```

## Theory-driven Naming {#sec-theory-driven-naming}

Prompts can express :

-   a context "instantiating" model parameters,
-   and an independent variable.

```{r}
# Example of in-context learning: machine translation
model_param <- "English: Hello, German: Hallo"
x <- "English: are you fine?"
y <- make_llama3_api_call(model_param, x) 
print(y)
```

## Use-case-driven Naming {#sec-use-case-driven-naming}

Prompts can express task-oriented information.

```{r}
# Use glue to create a formatted string
# Define sub-strings
en <- "Bye"
de <- "Ciao"

# glue together template and sub-strings to construct a dictionary
dictionary <- glue("English: {en}, German: {de}")
print(dictionary)

# define dictionary look-up key
key <- "English: Whatsup?"
value <- make_llama3_api_call(dictionary, key)
print(value)
```

# Recap: Reproducible Science {#sec-recap-reproducible-science}

::: callout-important
-   Reproducibility isn't a guarantee of quality
    -   Value depends on other factors like originality of the question, validity of hypotheses, relevance of results to the field, and the quality of conclusions drawn
    -   Specific context or conditions could limit the generalizability
-   Diversity in research standards: Physical experiments have different standards than social science studies
-   Human factors and interpretation can influence the interpretation and conclusions of results

# Exercise:

# 1. Correct poorly documented code

The provided code snippet performs a data analysis task but lacks proper documentation, comments, and variable labels. Your task is to enhance the code by adding comments, providing clear variable names, and improving readability. Rewrite the code to make it more understandable for future collaborators.

# Code

```{r}
f <- function(a) {
  if (!is.numeric(a) || a < 0) {
    return("Error!")
  }
  
  if (a < 16) {
    return("Too young")
  } else if (a < 18) {
    return("Beer and wine")
  } else {
    return("All good")
  }
}

# Function calls
print(f(15))  # Too young
print(f(17))  # Beer and wine
print(f(20))  # All good
print(f(-1))  # Error!
print(f("20"))  # Error!
```

## **Questions:**

1.  Identify at least three issues with the provided code example in terms of documentation and variable naming.
2.  Why is it important to have clear and descriptive variable names in code for reproducible research?
3.  How does adding comments to code contribute to the reproducibility of research?

# 2. Rework of last weeks code

Take a look at your code from last week and enhance its readability and reproducibility. Things to look out for could be

1.  Look at variable names. Are they self-explanatory?
2.  Place comments in places where they are needed
