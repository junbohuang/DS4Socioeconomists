# Pair programming? {#sec-pair-programming .illustration}

::: notes
::: nonincremental
-   Pair Programming is similar to driving a car: there is one driver and one/or more navigators
-   They work as a team:
    -   The navigator gives input and plans the route
    -   The driver then accepts this route or proposes a different route
    -   After both have agreed the driver takes this route
-   In real-time car driving
    -   one passenger might optimize for lowering the consumption of gas
    -   one might optimize for taking the shortest route
    -   and a third one might be optimizing for the most scenic route
    -   the same can happen with pair-programming
-   everyone brings different input to the table - the team decides what route the driver is going to take
-   and similar to driving a car: after being a driver for quite some time they get tired so the positions are switched within the team

## Why is pair programming important?[^1] {.smaller}

-   You're able to produce **better solutions**
-   You're able to **share knowledge** within your workflow
-   Everyone's an **expert** in something, and everyone has something to teach
-   Adds **accountability**: When working closely together no one wants to let their partner(s) down
-   Enables you to think and speak about different **alternative approaches**
-   Your **problem-solving abilities** are getting stronger
:::

## Groupwork {#sec-g}

-   Pair Programming takes place in small groups of 3 to 4 people

-   You can choose a group freely but binding - once you've joined (e.g.) the ***group number 13*** you're in this team for all exercises in these groups

# Using Jupyter Hub

-   We work in a shared folder on the Jupyter Hub. You can find it here <https://code.min.uni-hamburg.de>

-   Access can only be granted after the "Korrektur- and Nachmeldephase" ends on 24th of October

-   We will still show you how the folder is structured and how this tool works

-   Next week you can use it yourself
